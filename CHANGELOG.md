## 2011-01-18: Version 1.07
- Speed optimizations.

- Added evaluation of KQKP end games.
- Added evaluation term for two rooks on the 7th rank.
- Implemented delta pruning in the q-search.
- Improved reduction logic. Don't allow reduction of hash moves and killer moves, but allow larger reductions for other moves.

- Increased the passed pawn bonus and made it non-linear.
- King safety adjustment.
- Added a threat bonus evaluation term.

## 2010-12-31: Version 1.06
- Speed optimizations.
- Implemented non-linear mobility scores.
- Fixed bad interaction of futility pruning/hashing/fail soft.
- Tweaked rook piece square table a little.
- Order root moves according to search tree size on previous ply.

- Allow null move search to go directly into q-search.
- More depth reduction in IID at large depths.
- Implemented null move threat detection, to be able to undo unsafe LMR reductions. Idea from Stockfish.

## 2010-07-04: Version 1.05
- Speed optimizations.
